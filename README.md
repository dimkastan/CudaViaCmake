# CudaViaCmake
This is a very simple project using CMake in order to create a project for compiling cuda with cpp code.
I created this repo in order to allow other people have an entry point into creating -cmake- based projects 
supporting both cuda and c++
<br />
At the moment there are two demos available.
- Build single executable    [Demo_BuildSingleExecutable]
- Build multiple Executables [Demo_BuildMultipleTargets]
- Build a simple CuDNN demo [Demo_cuDNN]

Building instructions are provided in README.md files.
